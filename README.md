# Reverse-Tetris
	-Regular Tetris involves the player placing a sequence of blocks, with the goal not to surpass a height limit. In this game, what we call REVERSE tetris, the player gives a sequence of blocks to the COMPUTER. The player wins if the computer is unable to place the given sequence in the grid. 
	-NOTE: Because the computer is dependent upon a DP algorithm, special rules are applied for the algorithm to run in time. 
	-The game involves 5 levels and will report the score at the end, along with a congratulatory GIF. 
	-The sequel to this game is scheduled to be released in 08/2022.
